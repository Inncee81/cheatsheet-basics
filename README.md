# Cheatsheet & Summary Template

During my bachelor studies I wrote plenty of summaries for the courses. First using pen and paper, than Word and finally LaTeX. Therefore the template located in `tex/latex/cheatsheet` was created.

## Features

The template includes some basic packages for styling the output or faster creating the summaries. The main features are

* Landscape orientation
* Small borders
* Small font
* Column layout
* Predfined boxes (in different colors)
* Syntaxhighlighting for Sourcecode
* Some predefined commands for arrows

## Usage

Using the template can be quite easy.

* You can download the class file, locate it beside the actual tex document and start coding.
* You can place the folder structure anywhere on your pc and add it to paths of LaTeX Installation
* Use the dockerfile, build a docker container and use it for the conversation to PDF.
